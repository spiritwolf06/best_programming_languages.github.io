									<p align="justify"> Owned by the Oracle Corporation, Java is one of the oldest, most common, in-demand computer programming languages in use today. Well, think of some of your favorite web apps and games. It’s highly likely that Java plays a huge role in the code that makes them work. Another important factor which has kept Java’s magic intact among web development companies is its independence from platforms. This helps developers to essentially “write once, work anywhere”(WOWA). Java is everywhere and the demand for strong developers is literally high.</p>
