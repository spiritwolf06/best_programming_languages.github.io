										<h2>What are Programming Languages?</h2>
									</header> 
									<p align="justify">	<h7> <strong> Programming languages are formal languages comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output.
									          They are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Many different languages exist, and each one has its own unique features, though they all share some similarities. Because each language is different, each may be best suited for a certain purpose or purposes within certain industries. Some programming languages are used to create programs to solve problems or interpret data. Other programming languages are more suitable for creating software or apps that entertain. <strong> </h7> </p>
